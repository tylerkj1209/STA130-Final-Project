# STA130-Final-Project
My final project files for STA130 from 2021.

# Project overview and background
- The assignment for this project was to use data on early detective stories to answer hypotheses that I was to form based on what may be interesting to the professors who produced the data.
- There was an 18 slide limit on the presentation part of the assignment.
- I completed the assignment on my own, but working with partners was allowed.
