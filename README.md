# STA130-Final-Project
My final project files for STA130 from 2021. Included are the R markdown and knitted pdf files from the project. Some code is sourced from class lecture slides, but all analyses of the data and the majority of code are by my design.

# Project overview and background
- The assignment for this project was to use data on early detective stories to answer hypotheses that I was to form based on what may be interesting to the professors who produced the data.
- There was an 18 slide limit on the presentation part of the assignment.
- I completed the assignment on my own, but working with partners was allowed.
